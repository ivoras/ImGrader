# ImGrader

A simple photo filter / picker / grader tool for those of us who take thousands of vacation photos, of which only about a hunderd are worth keeping, and we don't want to spend weeks picking and filtering them.

ImGrader has an extremely simple mode of use:

1. Point it to a folder with thousands of images, all jumbled up into this one folder.
2. Use your keyboard to navigate and grade images: Left- and Right-arrows navigate to the previous / next image, Up- and Down-arrows upvote and downvote the current image, respectively. Use PgUp and PgDown to skip forwards / backwards by 100 images.
3. While you are upvoting and downvoting the images, ImGrader will move them in the background into subfolders named "1".."5", corresponding to the image grade.
4. You can use the "filter" command in ImGrader to show only images which have at least a certain grade, allowing you to further filter them, iteratively, until you arrive to the set of the best images.
5. Go to the folder with images, inspect the subfolders, copy them, move them, upload them, whatever. You're done.

In just two to three iterations of upvoting (and downvoting), with the help of ImGrader's very lean UI, you will quickly filter out the best images to share or save.
